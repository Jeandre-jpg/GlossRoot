<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

![Screenshot 2022-11-03 at 00 26-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55391556/199624139-cf43e126-ce5e-4990-906f-4511dbe941e0.png)


### Project Description
This term we were introduced to developing real-world applications using all the skills we’ve learnt throughout our time in this subject. We were to create and develop any AI-driven project with positive social, accessibility or environmental impact, using any language, development environment, or framework of our choice. 

Throughout the term, we explored the various services available currently, and the application thereof.

I decided to use SwiftUi in correlation with MlKits and Firebase for my data storage. By using these machine learning learning frameworks in a SwiftUI app I tried to solve real-world skin and beauty problems.

ML Kit is a mobile SDK that brings Google's machine learning expertise to Android and iOS apps in a powerful yet easy-to-use package. So there's no need to have deep knowledge of neural networks or model optimization to get started. 



### Built With

* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project.

### Initial designs

![Initial Designs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55391556/199625599-f2dd1e04-ed55-4870-88a9-dac25df416ce.png)


### User-flow

![User flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55391556/199625207-da4f1d03-e0f0-4a9f-ba50-f0a32946fc2a.png)


### ERD

![ERD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55391556/199625226-23de58d1-86b9-493a-829e-ef9a2c2f2211.png)


<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process


The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the backend of the application.

## Implementation Process

#### Design Architecture

SwiftUI was utilised for the design implementation of the application Gloss.

The SwiftUI API is very simple, due to its declarative nature. The abstraction is enough for Apple to offer us compatibility with all its platforms. One interface for all, where it would have been necessary to adapt the UI between UIKit and AppKit for example.


### Highlights

* I was thrilled to be designing and creating a project that had inclusivity and personal health at the forefront of my designs.

#### Challenges

* Working with SwiftUI after so long posed challenges having to relearn some of the structure and working toolkits I wasn't that familiar with.


## Reviews and Testing

### Unit Testing

The Reviews and Testing consists of in class, manual user testing. 

The questionare can be found here: [Manual Unit Testing](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiB2uFs9VjMZusn6Njhv4CdpwMbkrblBzNy9n5QqO34kRXEA/viewform )

#### Future Implementation

* Face Filter Functionality to apply beauty tutorials onto your face while following along.
* Expand on SkinCare and BeautyCare Products to immerse a full commerce application.
* Utilise tips, tricks and blog sections for those wanting to learn more or just starting out.
* Track your beauty goals for the next event coming up with a skincare routine.
